# This is an example of variables that should be encrypted with Ansible Vault
# To create your own vault file:
# 1. Create a password file: echo "your-vault-password" > .vault_pass
# 2. Add .vault_pass to .gitignore (already done)
# 3. Create encrypted vault: ansible-vault create group_vars/all/vault.yml
# 4. Edit this file and add your secrets

# Example secrets:
# vault_tailscale_auth_key: "tskey-auth-xxxxx-yyyyy"
# vault_ssh_password: "your-secure-password"
# vault_api_token: "your-api-token"

# Then reference them in your playbooks:
# tailscale_auth_key: "{{ vault_tailscale_auth_key }}"
